DeepakChopra_JavaScript
=======================

Deepak Chopra nonsense phrase generator implementation in JavaScript

Honestly, it's easier to just [see it in production](http://choprifier.com).

There are two directories.  One is "original" - the first, fun version.  If you want to learn how the software
works, look at that, please.  That has simple CSS, no twitter junk, no site support junk, etc.

The other is "production."  That's the one I actually use on [Choprifier](http://choprifier.com/).  If you want
to contribute words, please do; use the word list `word_list.js` in there.

I will set up minification Very Soon Now &trade;.



What the hell?

Nonsense generator, like the man.



Polemic :neckbeard:
